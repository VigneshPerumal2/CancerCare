Cancer is a disease of the genome, caused by genetic variations in genes. These mutations impact the processes that regulate how cells interact with their environment and grow.

The goal of this project is to develop a database tool that will allow us to examine patient information and get insightful knowledge about how frequently cancer occurs. Twitter database schema is also included in the cancer care system. The data is based on assessing the changing gene conditions in patients over time and will then be used to determine which type of treatment is most likely to save the patient because genes play a vital part in cancer detection.
